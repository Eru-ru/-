        <p>Hiii,  I really 
            liked you so much and I wanted to get to 
            know and understand you even deeper, 
            I find myself at peace and happy
            when I'm spending time with you.
            You and your gorgeous personality has drawn me closer. 
            And I was wondering if 
            you'd give me a chance to court you. 
            I appreciate your honesty, 
            and there's no pressure take your time if you need 
            some time to think about it :3</p>
